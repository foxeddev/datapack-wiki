# Functions

Functions are files essentially containing a list of Minecraft commands. Function files end in `.mcfunction`, and are
located in the `data/<namespace>/function` folder. Functions can be called (ran) using the `function` command. (See
[/function](/wiki/command/function) for more information)

The `function` folder can contain sub-folders for organisation. This changes their reference accordingly - for example,
a function located at `data/<namespace>/function/sub_folder/my_func.mcfunction` would be called using
`function <namespace>:sub_folder/my_func`.

When a function is run, the commands within it are executed in order. If the `return` command is run, the function stops
executing immediately and any commands after the return are ignored.

Any line in a function which starts with a `#` is a **comment**, and the game ignores it. Any other line is interpreted
as a command

### Example

This function will give every player an apple, then tell them to enjoy the apple.

```mcfunction
# Give a player the apple
give @a minecraft:apple

# Tell them to enjoy the apple
say Enjoy the apple!
```

## Macro functions

Macros can dynamically change part of a function by inserting NBT into it. Any function can define a macro within it. A
macro is a command beginning with `$`. Macros can use a special syntax: `$(<argument>)`. This will substitute for any
value provided as `<argument>` when run.

The `/function` command can specify a NBT compound to use as the macro values. In traditional programming, this is best
represented as `someFunction(foo, bar)`

### Example

In this example, we write a function that gives the player a number of diamonds using a macro.

```mcfunction:macro.mcfunction
# When called, $(count) will be replaced with some number, producing a valid command
$give @s diamond $(count)
```

```mcfunction:give.mcfunction
function example:macro {count: 7}

# This also works
data modify storage example:storage count set value 12
function example:macro with storage example:storage
```
