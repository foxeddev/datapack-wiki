# Advancements

Advancement files are used to create in-game advancements. These can have
display properties to make them visible to the player, like how vanilla
advancements work. In many function datapacks, we can use hidden custom
advancements to detect events (e.g player attacks entity) and then run a
function.

Advancements can be stored in trees. This means that an advancement can have
parent and children advancements. This tree format is good for showing
progression in different areas of the game, as well as allowing you to have
custom advancment tabs.

Advancement files are JSON files stored in the `/data/<namespace>/advancement`
folder.

## JSON Format

For information about the JSON format in general, see the
[JSON](/wiki/info/json) page.

Each advancement is represented by a JSON object stored in the advancement JSON
file. The advancment JSON object can have the following fields:

- `criteria`: An object containing the criteria/criterion that can trigger this
  advancement. (See the **Criteria** section below)
- `requirements`: This can optionally be used to specify more advanced rules as
  to which criteria trigger the advancement (for example, this can be used to
  specfiy "Advancement is given if (Criteria A OR Criteria B) AND (Criteria C OR
  Criteria D) is true"). This should be a list of lists of `criteria` keys - the
  advancement is given when at least one criteria from each list has been
  achieved.
- `display`: If left out, this advancement is completely hidden from the player.
  Otherwise, this will control the style of the advancement, and where it is
  displayed to the player. It has the following keys:
  - `icon`: An object defining the item used as the icon as the advancement.
    This has a `id` field (the item ID) and `components` (an object with the
    item components)
  - `title`: A text component representing the title or name of the advancement
    that is shown to the player
  - `description`: A text component representing the description of the
    advancement
  - `background`: (Root advancement only) The path to the background texture of
    the advancement tab
  - `frame`: Used to specify the frame (or type) of advancement. This should be
    either `"task"` (default), `"challenge"`, or `"goal"`.
  - `show_toast`: If true, a pop-up will be shown when a player completes the
    advancement. Defaults to true (if display exists).
  - `announce_to_chat`: If true, the advancement will be announced to chat when
    it is completed by a player. Defaults to true (if display exists)
  - `hidden`: If true, the advancement will not show up in the advancements menu
    until it has been achieved by the player. Defaults to false.
- `parent`: The ID of this advancement's parent advancement. This should be set
  if your advancement is not just for internal event purposes. If this is left
  blank, it is considered to be a root advancement.
- `rewards`: An object which stores data about what should happen to the player
  when the advancement has been achieved. This can contain the following fields:
  - `function`: The ID of the function to run as the player when they achieve
    the advancement.
  - `loot`: A list of loot table IDs to be given to the player when they achieve
    the advancement.
  - `recipes`: A list of the recipe IDs to be unlocked by the player when they
    achieve the advancement
  - `experience`: The XP points to give to the player when they achieve the
    advancement. This should be an integer
- `sends_telemetry_event`: (`minecraft` namespace only) Whether to send
  telemetry info about this advancement to Mojang. Defaults to `false`.

## `criteria`

The `criteria` object is an object containing the criteria needed to unlock this
advancement. This object should contain other objects - the key of which can be
anything, as it serves as the criteria ID. If the `requirements` field is not
used, the advancement will be achieved when all of the criteria have been
achieved.

Each criteria object contains a `trigger` and `conditions` fields. There are
many different `trigger`s that can be used, the contents of `conditions` depends
on which `trigger` is used.

:::info

The `player` condition can exist with any advancement trigger (except
`minecraft:impossible`). This condition can either be an object (an
`entity_properties` predicate) or a list of other predicates (any predicate
type) to further match the player.

You can see all the advancement criteria using a generator such as

## Using advancements to detect events

By specifying a `function` in the `rewards` section, and not including any
`display` information, you can make an advancement essentially just become an
event listener (something that will run a function when the player does
something). In order for this to work multiple times, the function must revoke
the advancement from the player (using `advancement revoke @s only ...`), so
that it can be regained later.

Note that the advanement will run the function **as** the player, but not **at**
the player.
