# Tags
Registry tags, not to be confused with [entity tags](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands/tag), are essentially lists of groups such as blocks,
items, entity types, etc. They use JSON format and are located in the `data/<namespace>/tags/<category>` folder.

## Special tags

Minecraft uses some tags internally for certain behaviours. These tags are
located in the `minecraft` namespace. For example:

- any functions in the `#minecraft:load` function tag will be automatically run
  when a datapack is loaded
- the `#minecraft:minable/pickaxe` block tag lists blocks which are mined faster
  using a pickaxe.

In many cases, modifying these special tags allows you to configure certain
aspects of how Minecraft behaves.

## Registries

Tags group various types in a specific registry (category), such as items,
blocks, functions, game events, chat types, etc.

This list shows some of the possible registry types, as well as the path their
tags should be put in.

| Registry Types    | Path                                         | Example Value                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Items             | `/tags/item`                                 | `"minecraft:apple"`            |
| Blocks            | `/tags/block`                                | `"minecraft:grass_block"`      |
| Entity types      | `/tags/entity_type`                          | `"minecraft:pig"`              |

| Goat horns        | `/tags/instrument`                           | `"minecraft:seek_goat_horn"`   |
| Paintings         | `/tags/painting_variant`                     | `"minecraft:skull_and_roses"`  |
| Entity POI        | `/tags/point_of_interest_type`               | `"minecraft:cleric"`           |
| Biome             | `/tags/worldgen/biome`                       | `"minecraft:plains"`           |
| Flat world preset | `/tags/worldgen/flat_level_generator_preset` | `"minecraft:classic_flat"`     |

| World preset      | `/tags/worldgen/world_preset`                | `"minecraft:large_biomes"`     |

## JSON format

For information about the JSON format in general, see the
[JSON](/wiki/info/json) page.

Tag files follow a very simple format, with two fields.

- `replace`: Can be `true` or `false` (defaults to `false`). If `true`, the tag
  will overwrite other tags with the same path. If `false`, it will merge with
  them.
- `values`: An array containing everything to group under this tag. Each element
  can either be
  - an id (e.g. `"minecraft:apple"`)
  - an object with an `id` field and a `required` field (e.g.
    `{"required": false, "id":"minecraft:stick"}`). If `required` is `false`,
    the tag will still skip nonexistent ids.

:::info

Tags can also reference other tags. For example, if a tag file contains
`#minecraft:logs`, it will also contain the entire contents of the
`minecraft:logs` tag. A tag is represented by an ID beginning with a `#`. For
more information, refer to the
[resource locations](/wiki/concepts/resource-locations#resource-locations-for-tags)
page.

### Example

Here is an example `item` tag file:

```json
{
  "replace": true,
  "values": [
    "#minecraft:logs",
    "#minecraft:planks",
    "minecraft:chest",
    "minecraft:stick"
  ]
}
```
