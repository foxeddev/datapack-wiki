# Recipes

Recipes are files which define crafting recipes in-game. They can be used to add
new recipes, or overwrite existing ones.  
Recipes are JSON files located in the `data/<namespace>/recipe` folder.

## JSON format

For information about the JSON format in general, see the
[JSON](/wiki/info/json) page.

Since recipe files represent a variety of different recipe types, the format can
vary. However, there are some fields which appear in every recipe file.
