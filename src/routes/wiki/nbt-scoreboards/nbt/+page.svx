# NBT
NBT (Named Binary Tags) is a structured (key/value) data format used by Minecraft to store data about entities, items, blocks, structures, player data, worldgen, and more. You can use it to store custom data in items and NBT storages.

## SNBT Format
SNBT (Stringified Named Binary Tags) format is a JSON-like tree structure used in datapack development to manipulate the
NBT data of an entity. SNBT is a human-readable version of NBT (Named Binary Tags), which is a format used by Minecraft
to store data. NBT is used to store data about entities, items, blocks, structures, game saves, and more.

SNBT consists of **key/value pairs**, which are represented as `key:value`. These are contained with **compounds**,
marked with curly brackets (`{}`). Compounds can contain multiple key/value pairs, which are separated with commas, like
so: `key:value,key:value,key:value`

An example SNBT structure looks like:
`{name:"Silabear",age:102,friends:["Flynecraft","Aandeel","Cobblestone"],socials:{discord:"silabear"}}`

## NBT paths
NBT paths are used to reference a specific location within an NBT structure. They are used in commands like `/data get` and `/data modify` to access or modify NBT data. 

NBT paths are made up of a series of keys, separated by dots (`.`). Square brackets (`[]`) can be used to access items in an array, either by index `array[0]` or by object value (`array[{age:102}]`)

Imagine the following NBT structure:

```javascript
{
  root: {
    version: 1,
    title: "Targets",
    people: [
      {name: "Silabear", age: 102},
      {name: "Aandeel", age: 100}
    ]
  }
}
```

The following are examples of NBT paths:
- `root.version`: would give the value `1`.
- `root.title`: would give the value `"Targets"`.
- `root.people[0]`: would give the value `{name: "Silabear", age: 102}`.
- `root.people[0].name`: would give the value `"Silabear"`.
- `root.people[{name:"Aandeel"}]`: would give the value `{name: "Aandeel", age: 100}`.
- `root.people[{name:"Aandeel"}].age`: would give the value `100`.

## NBT storages
Storages allow you to store NBT data in a world without binding it to a physical object (item, entity, block), but rather storing it under a namespaced ID (e.g `example:main`). Storages are stored globally per world, and can only be accessed with `/data`. Storages don't need to be initialized beforehand, unlike scoreboards.

Unlike entity and block NBT, storages have no fixed structure, and can contain whichever arbitrary keys are added to it.

### Storage example
Storages are defined when a `/data` command modifies them. Unlike scoreboards, storages do not need to be "created" -
the only code needed to initialize a storage is a `/data modify` or `/data merge` command to that storage, for example:

```mcfunction
data merge storage example:main {number: 1, message: "Hello!"}
data modify storage example:main other_number set from storage example:main number
data modify storage example:main compound.array append value 42
```

The `example:main` storage would now contain the following data:

<!-- Javascript is used here because it's almost identical syntax to SNBT -->

```javascript
{
  number: 1,
  message: "Hello!",
  other_number: 1,
  compound: {
    array: [42]
  }
}
```


## Data Types
There are a few data types you can use to represent different types of data, including whole numbers, decimal numbers,
string, text, booleans, and more.

### Strings

Strings can store any text value, or more technically, any sequence of unicode characters.

**Format**: Strings are stored within either double or single quotes. For strings containing standard characters
(`A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -,_,+,.`), the quotes are optional (as long as the text starts with a letter), but recommended. `"<text>"` or `'<text>'` or `<text>`

**Example**: `name:"Silabear"`, `name:'Cobblestone'`, `name:Aandeel`

### Whole Numbers

**Short**, **Int**, and **Long** data types all represent integers (whole numbers).

- **Byte** is an 8 bit integer, it can be any value from `0` to `255`
- **Short** is a 16 bit integer, it can be any value from `-32,768` to `32,767`
- **Int** is a 32 bit integer, it can be any value from `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`
- **Long** is a 64 bit integer, it can be any value from `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808` to
  `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`

**Format**: By default, numbers are stored as integers. To store a number in the other formats, you need to use the appropriate suffix. For shorts, ints, and longs, the suffixes are `s`, `i`, and `l` respectively.

The suffix can be extended with `u` or `s` to say whether it is unsigned (only a positive number) or signed (can be positive or negative) - for example, `402ub`.

It is also possible to write using E notation (e.g `1.2E3` would be `1200`), hexadecimals (e.g `0xBC` would be `188`), and binary (e.g `0b110` would be `6`)

**Example**: `count:1234s`, `bigNumber:1200000`, `reallyBigNumber:12123023687234L`, `byte:112b`

### Decimal Numbers

**Float** and **Double** data types both represent decimal numbers.

- **Float** is a signed 32 bit floating point number, it can be any value from `-3.4028235E38` to `3.4028235E38`. It is precise to 7 decimal places.
- **Double** is a signed 64 bit floating point number, it can be any value from `-1.7976931348623157E308` to
  `1.7976931348623157E308`. It is precise to 15 decimal places.

**Format**: By default, decimal numbers are stored as doubles. To store a number in the other formats, you need to use the
appropriate suffix. For floats, the suffix is `f`. For doubles, the suffix is `d`.

**Example**: `pi:3.1415926535d`, `e:2.718281828459045d`, `phi:1.6180f`

### Bytes or Booleans

In older versions of Minecraft, booleans were stored as bytes with `0b` representing `false` and `1b` representing `true`. In newer versions, booleans were introduced. Essentially, booleans represent the old `0b` and `1b` with a more descriptive name. It's recommended to use booleans instead of bytes whenever possible, as they are more readable.



### Lists/Arrays
Lists, or number arrays are used to store multiple values. Lists can store different types of values, whereas number arrays can only store the same type of number. In practicality, you often do not need to think about the difference

**Format**: They are defined using square brackets (`[]`), with the values separated by commas. Number arrays can be prefixed with the type of number the array is going to store and a semicolon (for instance, a list starting with `[B;` will only store bytes)

**Example**: `["Silabear", 15, true, 242]`, `[B;1b,2B,true,false]`, `["Kanokarob", "LadyEternal", "lionlance", "thederdiscohund", "theblackswitch"]`, `[L;1l,2l,3l,4l,5l]`
