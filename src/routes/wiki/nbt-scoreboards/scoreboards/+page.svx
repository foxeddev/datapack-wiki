# Scoreboards

Scoreboards are a key/value system for storing numbers bound to a player in
Minecraft. On a scoreboard objective, each player can have a score, which is an
integer value. This player does not need to exist - **fake players** can be used
to store a number without attaching it to a player but rather an arbitrary name.

You can modify objectives with the `/scoreboard` or `/execute store` commands.
Some objectives can automatically change based on player statistics.

Scoreboard objectives can also be optionally displayed on the sidebar, under a
player's name, and/or in the tab list - although only one objective can be shown
in each slot at a time.

## Types of scoreboard objectives

There are three main types of scoreboard objectives in Minecraft.

### Dummy objectives

These are objectives which can only be modified with commands, like a "blank"
scoreboard which you can modify however you want. They are useful for storing
arbitrary numbers, or tracking custom values within your datapack.

You can create this scoreboard with the command:
`/scoreboard objectives add objective_name dummy`. For a better example, take a
look at the following function:

```mcfunction
scoreboard objectives add intelligence dummy
scoreboard players set @a intelligence 100
execute store result score Silabear intelligence run data get entity Silabear Health
```

This would create the following scoreboard:

| Player   | `intelligence` |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Player1  | 100            |
| Player2  | 100            |
| Silabear | 20             |

You can also put **fake players** on a dummy objective. These work just like
normal players on an objective, except they don't exist. You can specify a fake
player by using a special character such as a `#`, `$`, `.`, etc. before the
name. For example:

```mcfunction
scoreboard players set #max intelligence 150
```

### Criteria-based objectives

These are read-only objectives which are automatically updated based on player
statistics. They are usually used to track player events or progress. For
example, the criteria `minecraft.custom:minecraft.sneak_time` will store the
amount of ticks a player has been sneaking on the objective.

```mcfunction
scoreboard objectives add sneaking_duration minecraft.custom:minecraft.sneak_time
```

After sneaking for one second, the objective will look like this:

| Player  | `sneaking_duration` |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Player1 | 20                  |

### Trigger objectives:

These are objectives which allow the player to manually set their score using
the `/trigger` command. This is especially useful for creating chat UIs, as it
is the closest thing we have to creating "custom commands" with datapacks. Any
player can run `/trigger`, regardless of their operator status.

A player may only run `/trigger` if that trigger objective has been enabled for
that user. Once a user has used `/trigger` on an objective, they cannot use it
again until it is re-enabled.

```mcfunction
scoreboard objectives add option trigger
scoreboard players enable @a option
```

Players will now be able to use the `/trigger` command to modify their score on
the `option` objective.

- `/trigger option` will set the player's score to 1.
- `/trigger option set 5` will set the player's score to 5.
- `/trigger option add 3` will add 3 to the player's score.

:::tip

There is also a way to disable a scoreboard objective for players, so that they
cannot trigger it until it is re-enabled:

```mcfunction
scoreboard players reset @a option
```
