# Commands
Commands are the basic building blocks of most datapacks. Each command is a simple instruction which can tell the game
to do something. Most datapacks are made primarily of [functions](/wiki/files/functions) - functions are just lists of
commands ran in order.

There are too many commands for this wiki to go over each one individually. However, important commands can be found in the **Command Reference** section of the sidebar.

## Command Context
Programming Minecraft command is unique. Commands are always run with context - this means commands always have a position (in a dimension), rotation, and executor entity. Functions inherit context from their caller, so if you run a function in chat, all the commands in the function will have the same context as if you ran them in chat.

Functions ran by the game, for instance tick, load, and scheduled functions, will have the follwing context:
- the executor is the game server. If you use `@s` in a command, it will not refer to any entity. 
- the position of the command is the world spawn
- the rotation of the command is `0, 0`

If you run a command in chat, then:
- you are the executor entity. If you use `@s` in a command, it refers to you.
- the position and rotation of the command are where you are standing and looking. If you use `~ ~ ~` in a command, it refers to where your position.

The `/execute` command will change the context of a command. For instance, this command would change the executor to the player `Silabear`, and the position of the command to `123 456 789`:
```mcfunction
execute as Silabear positioned 123 456 789 run say Hello!
```
