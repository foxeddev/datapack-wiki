# Resource Locations

A resource location is a way of referencing a resource in a datapack (or
resourcepack), such as a function.

## Example

This is an example of a resource location for a function:

```mcfunction
/function my_namespace:some_folder/my_function
```

This resource location would try and access the function
`/data/my_namespace/function/some_folder/my_function.mcfunction`. Notice how we
don't need to specify the `function` folder in the resource location, as it is
implied by the `/function` command.

## Resource locations for tags

To reference a tag (ie the function tag `#minecraft:load`), you can use the `#`
symbol before the tag name. For example:

```mcfunction
/function #minecraft:load
```

This resource location would try and access the tag
`/data/minecraft/tags/function/load.json`. In this case, all functions in the
tag would be ran.

## Default namespace

If the namespace (`my_namespace`, before the colon) is left out, it will default
to the `minecraft` namespace.

```mcfunction
/function some_folder/my_function
```

This resource location would try and access
`/data/minecraft/function/some_folder/my_function.mcfunction`.

## Allowed characters

A file name (and resource location) can only contain lowercase letters (`a-z`),
numbers (`0-9`), underscores (`_`), dashes (`-`) and periods (`.`). In a
resource location, `/` can be used to separate folders.
