# Ranges
A range specifies a set of values between two numbers. Ranges are used in some commands (such as `execute`) and selectors to specify a set of values to compare against.

For example, the `distance=` selector accepts a range to select entities within a certain distance from the player. The range `distance=..10` selects entities within 10 blocks of the player.

## Greater than (`x >= 10`)
To specify a range of numbers such as "x or greater", we can use the `min..` syntax. The following range represents "10 or greater". Note that this range includes `10`.
```
10..
```

## Less than (`x <= 10`)
To specify a range of numbers such as "x or less", we can use the `..max` syntax. The following range represents "10 or less". Note that this range includes `10`.
```
..10
```

## Between (`10 <= x <= 20`)
To specify a range of numbers between two values, we can use the `min..max` syntax. The following range represents "between 10 and 20". Like the other ranges, this range is inclusive: it includes both `10` and `20`.
```
10..20
```
