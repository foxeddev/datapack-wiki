# Creating Custom Item Models and Textures

This guide uses the `item_model` item component to change the model and texture of items with that component. It does not replace any vanilla items. It also goes over [spawning custom models in your world as an entity](#spawning-the-items-as-entities-in-game).

:::warning

Before Minecraft version 1.21., `CustomModelData` was used to change the look of items. It was replaced with item models
in Minecraft version 1.21.4, so it won't work in later versions. Item Models use a **completely different method**
compared to Custom Model Data.

:::

To add custom models or textures to the game, you will need a resouce pack. If you already have a resource pack or know
how to create one, you can skip to [Adding custom items](#adding-custom-items). If not, just continue reading.

## Creating an empty resource pack

Before creating your custom item, you will have to create a basic resource pack. For that, create an empty folder in
your `minecraft/resourcepacks` directory. Create a new file in that folder called `pack.mcmeta` and add the following
text:

```json:minecraft/resourcepacks/my_pack/pack.mcmeta
{
  "pack": {
    "pack_format": 69,
    "description": "<Description of your pack (optional)>"
  }
}
```

Add a new folder named `assets`, and a folder inside with the name of your **namespace**. This should be the name of
your resource pack, in small letters and with underscores (**\_**) as spaces.

Now to the fun part.

## Adding custom items

You will now have to decide it you want a simple, [2d item](#adding-custom-2d-items) (like for example a Totem of
Undying) or a custom [3d model](#adding-custom-3d-models).

### Adding custom **2d** items

To add a custom texture, make sure it's a **png** and place it in the `assets/namespace/textures/item` directory. You
can give it any name, but it makes sense to keep it lowercase and without spaces. Your texture will also have to have a
16x16 size.

Now, you will add the default Minecraft model for 2-dimensional items to your custom item. To do that, create a file in
`assets/namespace/models/item/your_item.json` with the following contents:

```json:assets/namespace/models/item/your_item.json
{
  "parent": "item/generated",
  "textures": {
    "layer0": "namespace:item/your_texture"
  }
}
```

You can now continue reading at [Adding the `item_model`](#adding-the-item_model)

### Adding custom 3d models

For creating your custom model, I recommend using [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/). It's the most popular
Minecraft model creation tool and even used by Minecraft itself. Export both the texture and the model as a
`Block/Item model`.

When you have your model and texture file, you will have to place your model in the
`assets/namespace/models/item/your_model.json` folder and your texture in
`assets/namespace/textures/item/your_item.json`. You can use any name, but it makes sense to keep it lowercase and with
underscores (**\_**) instead of spaces.

- Textures

Your model file will now probably look like this:

Replace all the values inside the `textures` bracket with `namespace:item/your_texture`.

:::warning

Do **not** add `.png`!

:::

### Adding the `item_model`

Next, you'll have to make the item available in Minecraft. To do this, you create this file in
`assets/namespace/items/your_item.json`:

```json:assets/namespace/items/your_item.json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "minecraft:model",
    "model": "namespace:item/your_item_model"
  }
}
```

This binds your model to the `item_model` component.

You can now add your texture to any item using this command:

```mcfunction
/give @s <any_item> [item_model="namespace:your_item"]
```

:::info

This command can also be used to change the texture of any item to another vanilla item texture without a resource pack
nor a data pack using a command like this:

```mcfunction
/give @s <any_item> [item_model="minecraft:vanilla_item"]
```

:::

## Spawning the items as entities in-game

You can spawn your created models in-game using an entity called an **Item Display**. An item display does what the name suggests: It displays items. And since you can change the model and texture of an item, you can also change them on an item display. You can spawn an item displays with your custom model/texture like this:

```mcfunction
/summon item_display ~ ~ ~ {item:{id:"minecraft:paper",count:1,components:{"minecraft:item_model":"namespace:your_item"}}}
```

:::info
In Minecraft: Java Edition, there is no good or simple way to animate your models. The best you can do is using multiple item displays and teleporting them/changing their `transformation` data.
