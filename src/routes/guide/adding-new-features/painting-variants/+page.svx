# How to add custom paintings

By the end of this guide, you will be able to implement your own custom paintings, which will show up in the creative inventory.

This will only work in 1.21+, as custom painting variants were added in the snapshot 24w18a. 
:::info 
This guide requires you
to have at least a small understanding of datapacks. If you don't understand this guide, you can read the [Getting Started
guide](/guide/getting-started). 
:::

## Setting up the datapack

To start you will need a basic datapack, if you don't know how to make one, see the
[Getting Started](/guide/getting-started) guide.

Firstly, we are going to create the main painting variant file in the directory `data/<namespace>/painting_variant/`.
You can name the file whatever you want, but it has to be in the `.json` file format. For the purposes of this tutorial, we're
going to call it `example_painting.json`. Inside, we will put and configure these settings:

```json:example_painting.json
{
  "asset_id": "<namespace>:example_painting-texture",
  "title": "Example Painting",
  "author": "Datapack Hub",
  "height": 1,
  "width": 1
}
```

This is a run-down of the fields in that file:
- `title`: A text component to use as this paintings title.
- `author`: A text component to use as this paintings author.
- `height`: A value between 1 and 16, represents the height of the painting when placed.
- `width`: A value between 1 and 16, represents the width of the painting when placed.
- `asset_id`: The resource location of the paintings texture to use. In this example, `example:texture_name` would direct to `assets/example/textures/painting/texture_name.png`.

If you are not sure what to put in `asset_id`, don't worry, the resource pack part is going to focus on that!

To finish with the datapack, we are going to have to add the newly created painting into Minecraft's `#minecraft:placeable` painting variant tag. This will allow the painting to be placed via the Painting item, and to be added to the creative inventory.
To do this, create a new file called `placeable.json` under `data/minecraft/tags/painting_variant/placeable.json`. Please note that the exact spelling and the use of the Minecraft namespace is required here!

```json:placeable.json
{
  "values": [
    "<namespace>:example_painting"
  ]
}
```

## Finish off with the Resource Pack

Lastly, we are going to add the actual painting texture file. This has to be placed in `assets/example/textures/painting/<example_painting-texture>.png` This texture, of course, has to have the same dimensions as the width and height you previously entered into the painting variant definition file.

Optionally, you can change the author and title in the datapack definition to use a resourcepack translation file. Which can be added into `assets/example/lang/<language_code>.json` under `"painting.<namespace>.example_painting.<author or title>"`.

## See it in action

Once you save the above files, you need to reload the resource pack with the keybind **F3 + T**
in-game. You will also need to leave and rejoin the world to update the datapack.

:::warning
For this to work, you will need to leave and rejoin the world, just using the `/reload` command won't do the trick here!
:::

You can either get the painting by using the normal painting item and placing it into a 1x1 spot, or by searching for "Example Painting" in the creative inventory.
