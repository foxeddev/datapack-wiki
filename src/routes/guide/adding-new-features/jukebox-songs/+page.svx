# How to add custom jukebox songs

In this guide, we will not only learn how to create custom jukebox songs, but
also how to give yourself a custom music disc item and implement custom sounds!

This will only work in 1.21+, as custom jukebox songs were added in the snapshot
24w21a.

:::info

This guide requires you to have at least a small understanding of datapacks, if
you don't understand this guide, you can read the
[Getting Started guide](/guide/getting-started).

:::

## Setting up the datapack

To start you will need a basic datapack, if you don't know how to make one, see
the [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started) guide.

Firstly, we are going to create the actual jukebox song file in the directory
`data/<datapack namespace>/jukebox_song/`. The file can be named whatever, but
it has to be in the `.json` file format. For the purposes of this tutorial,
we're gonna call it `example_jukebox_song.json`. Inside, we will put and
configure this:

```json:example_jukebox_song.json
{
  "comparator_output": 13,
  "description": {
    "text": "ARTIST - SONG NAME"
  },
  "length_in_seconds": 69.0,
  "sound_event": {
    "sound_id": "<namespace>:<title>"
  }
}
```

This is a run-down of the fields in that file:

- `comparator_output`: A value between 1 and 15, representing the redstone
  output when a comparator is placed next to the jukebox playing this song.
- `description`: The description of the enchantment (should be a JSON text
  component).
- `length_in_seconds`: The length of the song (in seconds).
- `sound_event`: The ID of the sound (from the resource pack) to play.

If you don't understand what to put in `sound_event`, don't worry, the next part
is going to focus specifically on this!

## Adding custom music - Resource Pack

This part is going to be optional in the case, that you only want a vanilla
Minecraft sound to play from the jukebox. In that case, change the `sound_id` in
the `example_jukebox_song.json` file from the datapack to the sounds ID. (for
example: `"sound_id": "minecraft:music_disc.cat"`).

If you don't want to use a default Minecraft sound, then a resource pack is
required to add the custom sound (in this case, the music on the disc) to
Minecraft, so that the datapack can read it.

:::info

Minecraft handles sound in `.ogg` files. There are many different converters you
can use to convert an MP3, WAV, or other audio file to .ogg.

:::

You need to add your `.ogg` file (the audio of your music disc) to
`assets/<namespace>/sounds/<title>.ogg`. Make sure that `<namespace>` and
`<title>` are the same values you put in the datapack's JSON file (the
`example_jukebox_song.json` file in our case).

Then, if you haven't already, you need to create a `sounds.json` file at the
position `assets/<namespace>/sounds.json`. This file tells Minecraft what audio
files map to what IDs. Put this inside:

```json:sounds.json
{
  "music_disc.<title>": {
    "sounds": [
      {
        "name": "<namespace>:<title>",
        "stream": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## See it in action

Once you save the above files, you need to activate the resource pack with the
keybind **F3 + T** in-game. You will also need to leave and rejoin the world to
update the datapack.

:::warning

For this to work, you will need to leave and rejoin the world, just using the
`/reload` command won't do the trick here!

:::

To get the music disc, you need to get an item which has the
`minecraft:jukebox_playable` component. This can be any item - it doesn't have
to necessarily be an already existing music disc (but you can if you want).

```mcfunction
give @s minecraft:YOUR_ITEM[minecraft:jukebox_playable={song:"<datapack namespace>:example_jukebox_song"}]
```

Then, you can use this item on a jukebox, and it should start playing your song!
