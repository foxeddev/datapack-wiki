# Choosing a Server

When you join a Minecraft server, you are playing on a computer running a
special software. This software allows you to interact with other players on the
server and play the game. There are so many different choices when it comes to
choosing Minecraft server JARs that it can easily become overwhelming.

In this guide, we focus on multiple aspects of the various servers, from
performance, to datapack support to even features that are exclusive to certain
server softwares.

## Background Information

Before we dive into the different server JARs, we need to talk about the
different types of Minecraft servers. Throughout this guide, we will be using
the term "server JAR" to refer to the actual Minecraft server file. These JARs
are Java executable files that run the Minecraft server.

There are a few common types of Minecraft servers:

- **Vanilla**: The vanilla server is the most basic server software, it's just
  the vanilla game.
- **Bukkit-based**: Bukkit is a plugin-based server software that is used by
  most Minecraft servers. It is the most popular of the server softwares as it
  provides a wide range of plugins and features.
- **Modded**: Modded servers are based on the Fabric or Forge, which are
  mod-based server softwares. They are more customizable than Bukkit-based
  servers, but are not as popular. The use of modded servers is still very
  limited, making it hard to find a mod for some purposes.
- **Sponge-based**: Sponge is a plugin-based server software that is used by
  many Minecraft servers. It is similar to Bukkit-based servers, but is more
  customizable and has support for mods with SpongeForge.

## Vanilla

The vanilla server is the most basic server software, and is the one that you
get when you download the jar file from the
[official website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server). It does not
come with mod or plugin support. Beyond datapacks, it is not customizable at
all.

| Pros                                            | Cons                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Easy to set up                                  | No mod support          |
| Fastest to update (comes out with every update) | Mediocre performance    |
| Designed with exclusively datapacks in mind     | Limited customizations  |
| No additional bug fixes                         | No additional bug fixes |

:::info

For some, a lack of bug fixes can be both positive and negative. Mileage may
vary!

:::

:::info

Even though it mentions bad performace, the vanilla server still has decent
performance. For small servers on decent hardware, it doesn't really matter what
you choose.

:::

## Spigot

[Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) is another popular server software, it comes
with some basic performance optimizations, and is not as customizable as Paper.
It can cause some issues with datapacks but mitigating datapack-related bugs is
significantly easier when compared to Paper. If you want plugins _and_
datapacks, this is likely the one you want.

| Pros                                       | Cons                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Popular and well-supported                 | Bad datapack support by default                     |
| Comes with basic performance optimizations | A bit older, May be lacking APIs other servers have |
| Datapack bugs are less common              | Not as customizable as other server softwares       |

## Paper

[Paper](https://papermc.io/) is a fork of Spigot, and it's the most popular
Bukkit server JAR according to [bStats](https://bstats.org/global/bukkit). It is
one of the most customizable server software on this list and comes with
excellent plugin support and amazing performance optimizations. Unfortunately,
it is notorious for breaking datapacks and even some plugins for the sake of
performance, modernity and bug fixes.

| Pros                                                         | Cons                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Popular and well-supported                                   | Breaks many datapacks due to destructive performance optimizations    |
| Numerous performance optimizations                           | Only designed for plugins                                             |
| Modern and forward-looking                                   | Can take a while to update due to relying on Spigot as a base         |
| Comes with extensive documentation and configuration options | Some useful bugs are fixed by default (TNT duping, sand duping, etc.) |

:::note

Until recently, Paper was based Spigot, but recently, they converted the project
into a hard fork (no longer based on Spigot), however, the software is still
slow to update and make stable releases.

:::

## Forge

[Forge](https://minecraftforge.net/) is a mod-based server software used
primarily by older Minecraft servers. Forge is the gold standard for mods for
versions >1.13 while still offering support for latest versions. Many mod packs
such as RLCraft, Pixelmon, ATM (All The Mods) will **only** run on Forge. Forge
is still updated to latest versions, however, newer loaders are recommended.

| Pros                                  | Cons                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Great for older Minecraft versions    | By choosing older versions, you miss out on DP features |
| Large mod catalog spanning many years | Different mod loaders are recommended nowadays          |
| Many mods do not affect DP features   |                                                         |

:::note

It's recommended to use [NeoForge](#neoforge) on the latest version when
possible. This will offer the bestest of Datapack features and the most modern
mods

:::

:::warning

By choosing an older Minecraft version you will lose out on a lot of cool
datapack features.

:::

## NeoForge

[NeoForge](https://neoforged.net) is a mod-based server software used by many
Minecraft servers. It is a fork of Forge designed to be cleaner and more modern,
with significant reworks to many bloated parts of Forge. It is designed to be
used with new versions of Minecraft and many mods that did target the latest
version of Forge will now target NeoForge or both!

| Pros                                | Cons                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Great for newer Minecraft versions  | Finding mods in general is hard                            |
| Great modding community             | Different mod loaders may provide a larger catalog of mods |
| Many mods do not affect DP features |                                                            |

## Fabric

[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) is another mod-based server software. Fabric is
used by most modern modded servers due to its fast boot time, advanced injection
and great mods. Fabric is likely the best _modded_ server for use with datapacks
due to how it injects its code.

| Pros                               | Cons                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Popular and well-supported         | Finding server-side mods are hard               |
| Mods rarely affect datapacks       | Hard to troubleshoot                            |
| Great for newer Minecraft versions | Support for older Minecraft versions is limited |

:::tip

You may see people talk about Cardboard. It's a mod that can add the Paper API
to your Fabric server, but the actual functionality is very limited and its slow
to update.

We do not recommend you use it! Instead, try find native Fabric alternatives!

:::

## SpongeVanilla

[SpongeVanilla](https://spongepowered.org/downloads/spongevanilla) is the
vanilla version of Sponge. It is an alternative to Bukkit-based server jars with
incredible extensibility. It is very rarely used due to the lack of mods/plugins
supporting it.

| Pros                               | Cons                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| High quality plugins are common    | Support for newer Minecraft versions is experimental |
| Generally fast                     | Server support is hard to find                       |
| Great for older Minecraft versions | Finding Sponge mods are hard                         |

## SpongeForge

[SpongeForge](https://spongepowered.org/downloads/spongeforge) is a version of
Sponge with support for Forge mods. Similarly to SpongeVanilla, it is very
rarely used due to the lack of mods supporting it.

| Pros                               | Cons                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Support for plugins and mods       | Support for newer Minecraft versions is experimental                             |
| Plugins are well integrated        | Generally not as popular as Bukkit-based servers                                 |
| Great for older Minecraft versions | Finding Sponge mods are hard, support for Forge mods is pinned at lower versions |

## Honorable Mentions

### Minestom

Minestom is a very high performance, lightweight server jar designed for extreme
customizability at the expense of doing everything yourself.

:::warning

This server jar is basically an empty shell and is only recommended for highly
technical purposes. You need to program everything you want into this server
yourself, including features you may expect to come with the jar (lighting). You
have been warned!

:::

| Pros                                                | Cons                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Extremely high performance                          | Almost everything must be manually implemented |
| Uber customizable, anything you dream is possible!  | HIGHLY TECHNICAL! Expect many errors with DIY  |
| Absolutely no obfuscation, the protocol is readable | An understanding of networking may be required |

### Proxies (BungeeCord, Velocity, Waterfall, etc.)

These "servers" are different from the rest, as they themselves are not servers,
but rather [proxies](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server).

Most Minecraft servers can't handle more than a hundred-or-so people at once, so
how do giant servers like Hypixel have tens of thousands of people on at one
time? Imagine a large server with many mini games. Every time you teleport to a
game, a proxy is sending you to a completely different server, usually dedicated
to running **just** that game. Larger servers can have thousands of people
online at a time because not everyone is in one server, they are split between
tens or hundreds of servers. Simply put, the proxy is like glue, sticking
servers together and allowing people to "teleport" between them.
