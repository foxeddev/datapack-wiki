# Player ID System
This guide will explain how to create a player ID system within a datapack. A player ID system gives each player a unique score on a scoreboard, which can then be used to link players to entities, or for the player to be able to select another player easily.

## Assigning player IDs
Firstly, we need to create a scoreboard objective to store the players' IDs. This scoreboard will also hold a counter of the IDs given in a fake player so that no two players end up with the same ID.

```mcfunction:load.mcfunction
# Create the playerid scoreboard
scoreboard objectives add playerid dummy
```

Next, we need to assign an ID to the player when they first join the world. Create a function which assigns the value of the max player ID counter to the player, and then increments it by one.

```mcfunction:assign_id.mcfunction
# Assign the max player ID to the player
# (When this is first ran, .max playerid is not set and read as 0, so the first player gets the ID 0)
scoreboard players operation @s playerid = .max playerid

# Increment the max player ID by one
scoreboard players add .max playerid 1
```

Finally, we need to make this function run when a player first joins the world. We can do this using a `tick` advancement - it will only trigger when the player first joins the world.
```json:first_join.json
{
  "criteria": { 
    "requirement": { 
      "trigger": "minecraft:tick" 
    } 
  },
  "rewards": { 
    "function": "<namespace>:assign_id" 
  }
}
```

## Find the player/entity with a specific ID
We can use a predicate to check if the player has the same ID as the specified ID (stored in a fake player on a scoreboard). In this case, this predicate will only trigger if the player's `playerid` score is equal to the `playerid` score of the fake player (`#this`).

```json:namespace:match_id.json
{ 
  "condition": "minecraft:entity_scores", 
  "entity": "this", 
  "scores": {
    "playerid": {
      "min": { "type": "minecraft:score", "target": { "type": "minecraft:fixed", "name": "#this" }, "score": "playerid" },
      "max": { "type": "minecraft:score", "target": { "type": "minecraft:fixed", "name": "#this" }, "score": "playerid" }
    }
  }
}
```

We can call this predicate any time we want to find the player or entity with a specific ID - just set the `#this` fake player to the score you want to match, and then call the predicate as all entities or players. This function will return all the entities with the same ID as the executor:

```mcfunction:find_id.mcfunction
# Set #this to the current entity's ID
scoreboard players operation #this playerid = @s playerid

# Find all entities which have the same ID
execute as @e[predicate=<namespace>:match_id] run say I have the same ID.
```
