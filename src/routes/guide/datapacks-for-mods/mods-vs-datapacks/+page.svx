# Mods vs Datapacks

Mods and datapacks are two commonly confused topics in Minecraft, and knowing the difference between them could help you
decide which better fits your use case. While both mods and datapacks extend Minecraft's capabilities, mods generally offer more control and customization, while datapacks are more integrated with the base game and rely on the server environment.

## What is a mod?

Simply put, mods are modifications to the base game, which includes [Java code mods](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mod),
datapacks, resource packs and Bukkit plugins. In this guide, we will only address two of these topics, Java code mods
and datapacks. _For the remainder of this guide, when you read mod, we will be referring to Java code mods._

## Datapacks

Datapacks are extensions to vanilla features and are officially supported by Mojang Studios. Datapacks are becoming
increasingly powerful with the advent of new data-driven features, commands and technical additions such as interactions
or block displays. For these reasons, datapacks make an excellent addition for a vanilla server or even some modded servers, who don't want to worry about incompatibilities or dealing with broken plugins/mods.

Datapacks can be used to define custom world generation, [advancements](/wiki/files/advancements), enchantments, loot
tables, [recipes](/wiki/files/recipes) and many contain [command functions](/wiki/files/functions); small scripts which run Minecraft commands (with some small caveats). Datapacks use these functions to create unique mod-like features or add interactivity in maps. Many impressive datapacks can be so well made they are confused for mods, which is
where some of the confusion between them and mods stem from.

Due to how they work, datapacks can be more limited compared to mods. New features have to be added by Mojang themselves
before they can be used in datapacks and many custom features such as custom entities and custom blocks have yet to be
implemented. In addition to this, _anything_ that requires the Minecraft client such as rendering changes or key input
is not possible, as datapacks are installed on the server/world.

## Mod

Mods are unofficial changes to the game's code using Java and in most cases a mod loader such as Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, etc.
__Mods are not supported by Mojang Studios.__ Mods allow you to do anything you want with the game on both the client and the server.
They give you full control of everything in the game from game rendering, to blocks, to key input, to even networking. They allow for
much more complex interactions with some minor caveats.

:::warning
Do not install mods from suspicious sources, as they have near full access to anything on your computer including sensitive files.

Always download from a reputable distributor such as [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/)!
:::

:::info
Mods can include data and asset files alongside code. This includes shipping model/texture files in the resource pack format, recipe files in the datapack format, and more.

In some cases, mods can simply be datapacks in a specially formatted JAR file!
:::

Mods that add blocks or unique interactions can only be used on servers if everyone on the server uses the required mods, which can be hard to manage especially with larger packs. Mods can also be harder to debug and troubleshoot, especially if they utilize parts of Minecraft's obfuscated code. A strength of datapacks is that anyone can join a server that uses them since they are fully vanilla.

## Summary of Differences

As you may have read, datapacks and mods are very different and can be used for very different use cases. Below we've summarized some of the important points into a handy-dandy list!

|Mods|Datapacks|
|---|---|
|Allow for full control over all of Minecraft's code|Modify the base systems of the game|
|Can contain datapacks in the form of data folders|May contain command functions along with system modifications such as recipes or world generation|
|Full control over everything in game/server and out of game (could be a security risk)|Limited to server-side changes of game mechanics, malicious datapacks are much safer than malicious mods|
|Generally faster and can improve game and server performance due to high level of control|Generally slower but more lightweight and less resource hungry|
|Ideal for modifying the game in ways datapacks cannot (e.g custom blocks, new mobs) or adding new mechanics/systems|Ideal for small mods that modify existing systems, "vanilla" looking mods and map making|
|Server owners must verify mod compatibility between clients|Any client can use datapacks, making them easy to manage|
|May require some knowledge of Java to use and debug effectively|In most cases, easier to debug|
