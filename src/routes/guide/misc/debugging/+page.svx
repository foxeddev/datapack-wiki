# Debugging your datapacks

There will come times when your datapack won't work, and you will have to figure
out what exactly doesn't work in it. Don't worry if this happens to you, if
you're like any of the rest of us, this will happen often. Code will almost
never work the first time you try it. An error in your code is referred to as a
bug. Removing these bugs is called debugging. This guide will teach you the best
methods for debugging datapacks.

## What are bugs?

Bugs are a fancy programmer term for an error in your code. There are two main
types of bugs:

- **Syntax error**: This is a bug in the actual written code. This is caused by
  the code you write being incorrectly written so that the computer literally
  can't read it. For example, writing `executr as @a` would be a syntax error
  because `executr` isn't a command.
- **Logic error**: This is a bug where the written code is correctly written,
  but the code doesn't do what you want it to. This is caused by a mistake in
  the code logic. In the simplest example, if you want to give a player 32
  diamonds, but you accidentally wrote 322.

## Finding and debugging syntax errors

Syntax errors are pretty easy to spot and fix, due to Minecraft's output logs,
which literally tell you if your code is incorrect. When you're coding
datapacks, its a good idea to always have the logs open if you need to double
check it. You can open the logs by opening the default Minecraft launcher and
clicking "Settings", and then enabling "Open output log when Minecraft: Java
Edition starts", then just starting the game.

Syntax errors will show up in **red text** when you `/reload` your datapack. But
sometimes other errors can also show in **yellow text** instead.

Lets take this image as an example:
![Output log with an error.](https://i.postimg.cc/hjkYKHGT/image.png) Here, the
error tells you exactly where the error is - in this case it's in the function
"be:give" at line 1 after ".... give @s". And indeed I did spell "loot" as
"lot", which caused the error.

## Finding logic errors

Logic errors are more difficult to find because there's nothing actually
incorrect with the code you wrote, it just does something other than what you
want it to do.

An easy way to find where a logic error is in the code is to make use of the
`say` or `tellraw` command. These commands will send **any message** to the
chat, making it easy for you to know when and if your code actually runs **as
you expect it to**. You can easily put a
`say Function <function_name> ran correctly` command in your function - If the
function runs, then it will send a message to the chat. It will also send the
**name of the entity that ran the function** to the chat, so you can see if your
function is executed by the correct entity.

Similarly, you can use the `tellraw` command for more advanced debugging. The
tellraw command also has the capability to show you the value of scoreboards and
NBT values, so you can check what data your code is using. For instance, if you
want to check the value of a scoreboard, you could use the following command:

```mcfunction
tellraw @a {"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"some_scoreboard_objective"}}
```

Based on the output of these commands in chat, you can use this to tell where
your code goes wrong. (Just make sure to remove them after you've found the
error, otherwise it can get annoying).

You may want to keep the debug messages in the datapack, but you don't want it
to be sent to every player. Fortunately for us, with the `tellraw` command, you
can specify to who the message will be sent. This means you could only send the
debug messages to those who have the tag `debug`:

```mcfunction
tellraw @a[tag=debug] {"text":"Debug message sent only to people with the debug tag!"}
```

## Debugging logic errors

Unfortunately, debugging logic errors in your code isn't as easy as fixing one
spelling mistake. But yet there are still techniques that we can use.

One way to solve logic errors is to recreate the error in a separate project.
When you remove all the other context of the pack, you can focus just on the bit
which doesn't work. You can just copy out the code you want to fix into a
separate datapack, then fix it there. Once you've identified and fixed the
problem, you'll know how to fix it in the real project.

## Summary

The first main method for debugging datapacks is using Minecraft's output logs,
we've already learnt how to use those in the first part of this guide. The
second method is using the in-game commands, like `/say` and `/tellraw` to print
information in real-time about how your datapack works. But those are not the
only ones, you can use the `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay <objective>`
command to show the values of a scoreboard on your screen in real-time, or you
can use `/data get ...`, which will print the value of any NBT data in chat.

You might also find that some other methods that suit you the best, for example
you might find the [Data Reload](https://modrinth.com/mod/data-reload) mod
useful for displaying errors in chat, or a completely different method, that is
up to you.
