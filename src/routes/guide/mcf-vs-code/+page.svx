# MCFunction vs Traditional Coding

Many people will join the datapack community with experience with traditional programming languages. While this can be
helpful for understanding topics, there are a lot of differences between the two, many of which can seem confusing when
you are used to a more traditional programming language. In this guide we touch on some common questions and problems people run into when
trying to apply traditional coding logic to MCFunction.

## Q: How do you do variables in MCFunction?

MCFunction isn't like most programming languages, MCFunction uses scoreboards, storages and macros (1.20.2+) as their variables.

[Scoreboards](/wiki/nbt-scoreboards/scoreboards) are like a table. They store a name and a value which you can then retrieve and modify later. You can use both entity names/UUIDs and "fake player" 
names (names not associated with any player), allowing for easy combination of variables and entity scores. Scoreboards can only hold 32-bit integers and other data 
types (such as floats, doubles or strings) can not be stored this way.

[Storages](/wiki/nbt-scoreboards/nbt#nbt-storages) are a way of storing [NBT data](/wiki/nbt-scoreboards/nbt) without attaching it to an entity or block. Storages are stored globally per 
world and unlike scoreboards, don't need to be initialized beforehand. Unlike entity and block NBT, storages have no fixed structure, and can contain whichever 
arbitrary keys are added to it.

[Macros](/wiki/files/functions#macro-functions) are like fancy string templating, when a function is supplied with macros, it will go through the function file
and replace the macro with its value (block, entity, storage). Interestingly, this also works function-wide, meaning you could use them as mock arguments.

:::warning
Macros can be significantly slower than other methods, it is best to only use them when necessary or in non-performance-critical code.
:::

Below are some examples of their usage:

```mcfunction
# Scoreboards
# creates a new table called storage
# (dummy means it does not track any statistic)
scoreboard objectives add storage dummy

# adds a fake player named "$steps" to storage (using prefix "$" to avoid collisions with real players, good practice)
scoreboard players set $steps storage 41

# sets the value of a player to 42
scoreboard players set Cbble_ storage 42

# Macros
# Run cool function with a macro
function dph:cool_function with block ~ ~ ~ Items
function dph:cool_function with entity @e[type=minecraft:squid,limit=1,sort=nearest] CustomName
function dph:cool_function {Potato:true}

# Usage with entity NBT:
execute as @p run dph:cool_function with entity @s SelectedItem

# this is in the dph:cool_function function
$say The player running this function is holding $(count) items with ID $(id)!

# Storages
data merge storage example:main {number: 1, message: "Hello!"}
data modify storage example:main other_number set from storage example:main number
data modify storage example:main compound.array append value 42
```

## Q: How do you loop in MCFunction?

Looping in most cases is done with 1 of 2 methods, depending on the use case:

1. **Recursive Function Calls:** This is when a function calls itself which will loop until some end condition is met, or forever, if one is never met.
2. **Tick Functions** (`#minecraft:tick`): This is a special tag you can declare that will run every function declared in it every tick, it is best
practice to only have one of these function in a datapack at a time.

## Q: How do you make functions/methods?

Every MCFunction file is its own function which you can run with the `function` command. MCFunction does not support inheritance and inherited functions, 
but you can call any function from anywhere in your datapack.

```mcfunction
function <function> [...]
```

## Q: How do I do conditionals?

You can also do some basic conditionals with [selectors](/wiki/concepts/target-selectors), but most if not all conditionals are done with the 
[`execute if`](/wiki/command/execute#execute-ifunless-ltconditiongt-) subcommand, which accepts a variety of different inputs and check if they match/are equal. 
You can learn more about `execute if` on the [execute page](/wiki/command/execute#execute-ifunless-ltconditiongt-).

## Q: How do you do math/expressions?

MCFunction does math in an interesting way; it uses scoreboard operations in order to do math. Using the `scoreboard players operation` subcommand, you can do a 
[variety of math operations](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Scoreboard#Score_operations).

:::note
MCFunction does not come with complex math like trigonometry, absolutes, a pre-defined Pi, or even square root! These all must be implemented either by 
hand or with a third-party library.
