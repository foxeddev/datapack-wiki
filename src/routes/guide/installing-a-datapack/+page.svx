# Introduction

So you've found a nice datapack for Minecraft, and the next step is to get it
into your game. This guide will explain how to install a datapack onto a world
which exists, a new world.

## Installing a datapack to an existing world

1. In your world menu, find the world which you want to install the datapack on.
   Click **Edit**.

4. Put the datapack zip file into the folder.

   > If the zip folder contains a folder which contains `data` and
   > `pack.mcmeta`, then put that folder in the datapacks folder instead of the
   > full zip. Putting the zip in the datapacks folder **only works** when
   > `data` and `pack.mcmeta` are directly in the root folder of the zip.
5. Rejoin the world and run /reload.

## Installing a datapack to an new world

1. Go to the Create New World screen. Make sure that you enable cheats.

   versions.

   > If it doesn't show up, then it's likely that the zip file contains a folder
   > which contains the datapack, and not the zip file just containing the
   > datapack. You need to take the folder out of the datapack, and put it in
   > the datapacks folder (click the "Open Packs Folder" button to open it.)
4. Click on the datapack icon to apply it to the world.
