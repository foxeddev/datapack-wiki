# Consumable Component Right Click Detection

The `minecraft:consumable` component can be a helpful indicator of when an item
is right clicked by the player in a Minecraft datapack. We can detect usage of
an item with the `consumable` and `food` components with an advancement which
can trigger a function. This method can be used on almost any type of item.

:::warning

This method will work for any type of item. However, if the item type already
has a default rightclick functionality (such as placing a block), it will keep
that functionality. This method is best used for items that don't have a default
rightclick functionality.

## Method

To detect when the item is being used (in this case, being right clicked), you
must create a `using_item` advancement, and specify the item data you want to
trigger the advancement. Then, you can specify a reward function which will be
run when the advancement is triggered.

```json:click.json
{
  "criteria": {
    "requirement": {
      "trigger": "minecraft:using_item",
      "conditions": {
        "item": {
          "items": [
            "minecraft:<item>"
          ],
          "predicates": {
            "minecraft:custom_data": {"custom_id": "your_custom_item_id"}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "rewards": {
    "function": "<namespace>:rightclick_run"
  }
}
```

In the function (in this case,
`/data/<namespace>/functions/rightclick_run.mcfunction`), you can put commands
that you want to run when the item is clicked. Make sure that this function also
**revokes the advancement** so that it can be triggered again next tick.

```mcfunction:rightclick_run.mcfunction
# Revoke the advancement from the player so it can be used again
advancement revoke @s only <namespace>:click

# Custom logic
say I right clicked the item!
```

After `/reload`ing the datapack, we will now need to give the player the item
with the custom food and data components.

```mcfunction
give @p <item>[consumable={consume_seconds:999999999,animation:"none"},food={nutrition:0,saturation:0,can_always_eat:true},custom_data={custom_id:"your_custom_item_id"}] 1
```

Now, when you right click this item, it should send a message to the chat saying
`I right clicked the item!`.
